## Description 
    A custom designed portfolio that showcases what I've learend since I began coding a just 3 months ago. The contact portion actually works by using emailJs. Currently building an api to manage this for me directly.

## Installation-Guide
    This is a react app. Fork over the repo and run `npm i`. Then `npm run start` which will run a locally hosted version of my portfolio. Feel free to use this a template for your own! Though make certain to switch the email handling in the contact component.
